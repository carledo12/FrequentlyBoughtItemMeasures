// Confidence is the percentage of transactions that contain the two products together, out of the transactions containing one of the two products.
//As a consequence, there are always two confidence numbers for each couple of products.

// Confidence is useful because it gives the direction of the cross-selling. We can make the hypothesis that it's easier to sell whipped cream to someone buying berries (whipped cream is a nice addition to berries), compared to the opposite. 

//Confidence, however, does not give us the strength of the relationship between the products. One product might be a very common purchase so that it generates high numbers for confidence, independently from the second product.
